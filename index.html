                    Hackers exploit system vulnerabilities to access sensitive data, threatening cybersecurity. These breaches endanger personal information and network integrity. As technology evolves, so do cyber threats. Encryption, firewalls, and regular updates help mitigate risks. Since the 1990s, cybersecurity has advanced with AI and machine learning, detecting threats like ransomware, phishing, and malware more effectively.

                <p>Cybersecurity is the process of protecting digital information and systems from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. With the increasing use of the internet, cybercriminals are attempting to breach systems using new methods. To ensure effective cybersecurity, techniques such as encryption, firewalls, and multi-factor authentication are used. Cyberattacks like phishing, malware, and ransomware pose significant threats, so regular updates and monitoring are essential for protection. Building a secure digital environment through cybersecurity is crucial for safety.</p>

                    When a hacker discovers a vulnerability in a system and exploits it to steal or manipulate data, the consequences can be severe. This threat has existed for decades, with cybercriminals continuously evolving their methods to breach networks and access sensitive information. Even as technology advances, the core challenge of securing systems remains unchanged. In the early days, simple firewalls and encryption techniques were used to protect data, but as cyberattacks have become more sophisticated, so too have cybersecurity measures, adapting to defend against increasingly complex threats.
